1. Grant of License

Subject to full and timely payment of all fees and continuous compliance with this License, Licensor grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and run the Software for Licensee’s internal business purposes only. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the license is limited to one (1) production instance serving a single organization.

2. “No Pay, No Play” – Fees & Activation

If any amount is unpaid or reversed (e.g., chargeback), this License automatically suspends and Licensor may disable access (including keys/tokens) without notice. Reinstatement requires payment of all past due amounts plus any applicable reactivation fees.

Licensee shall not (nor permit any third party to):

copy, distribute, sublicense, sell, host, rent, or provide the Software as a service to others;

modify, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works, except to the extent a right cannot be restricted by law;

remove, hide, or alter attribution or proprietary notices, including the “Powered by ZARI” requirement (Section 4);

use the Software to build or train any AI/ML model, dataset, or derivative system (including via prompts, logs, or outputs);

publish benchmarks, performance tests, or security assessments without Licensor’s prior written consent;

use the Software to operate or assist a competing service or to support more instances/locations than licensed;

circumvent technical limitations, rate limits, or license controls.

4. Required Attribution – “Powered by ZARI”

Licensee must display “Powered by ZARI” in a reasonably visible location in the user interface (e.g., footer or sidebar) and retain the same in any About/Help section and README. Attribution must remain visible in all deployments. Removal or obscuring of attribution is a material breach.

5. Updates; Support

Licensor may provide updates or patches at its discretion. Unless a separate support agreement exists, the Software is provided without support, SLAs, or uptime guarantees.

6. Data & Privacy

Licensee owns its own business data. Licensor may process diagnostic/usage data solely to provide the Software, enforce this License, and improve security. Licensor will not use Licensee content to train Licensor’s models without Licensee’s written consent.

7. Confidentiality; Keys

All license keys, tokens, documentation, and non-public information are Confidential Information. Licensee shall protect them with at least reasonable care and not disclose them except to employees/contractors with a need to know and bound by confidentiality obligations.

8. Compliance & Audit

Upon 5 business days’ notice, Licensee shall provide reasonable information/logs to verify compliance (instance count, domains, users). If an audit reveals under-licensing, Licensee must promptly purchase the required licenses and pay any related fees.

9. Term & Termination

This License continues until terminated. Licensor may terminate immediately upon non-payment, material breach, or misuse. Upon termination, all rights cease and Licensee must stop using and delete all copies of the Software and keys. Sections 2–4, 6–13 survive termination.

Exclusive venue lies in state or federal courts located in Maryland, and the parties consent to personal jurisdiction there.
